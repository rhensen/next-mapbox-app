A simple CURD application using Next js, MongoDB, and MapBox.  
You can view a live demo over at [Wild Pig Tracker](https://wild-pig-tracker.vercel.app)

## Technology Used
- Next js
- MongoDB
- MapBox
- [React-map-gl](http://visgl.github.io/react-map-gl/)

## Getting Started

- Clone this repo.

- Add API keys and database connection.

  To run this application localy:

  1.  First, you need a Mapbox access token, logging into [mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/) to get one for free.
  1.  Second, you should have a MongoDB database URL connection.

  For best practice, add these keys to a .env.local file, or feel free to change them directly in the map folder and utils folder.

- Install dependencies and run the development server.

  1. Instal dependencies:

     ```bash
     npm install
     # or
     yarn install
     ```

  2. Run developement server:

     ```bash
     npm run dev
     # or
     yarn dev
     ```
